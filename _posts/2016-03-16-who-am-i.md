>-  from 2002 to 2008, I was working Mitac(SH),a taiwan commany, even it is an old story, while i still remember,shamefully, stingy taiwanese..
>-  Thanks to an old woman hunter ringed me out from that little commany at 2008, i worked for IBM for 6years till 2014,that was a hard but happy career. independent,confident,respect. Big blue is really very very big as what you can image,like the blue sky and the blue sea
>-  God knows why lenovo can buy IBM system x, so i am working for lenovo now,focusing on Openstack,SAP HANA and Nutanix..
